         <p class="para"> For starters, we need to know how to handle a Rubik's cube, and how to move sections by reading 
            Rubik's movement notation. Each face/section of the cube has a corrisponding marker for rotating 
            clockwise and counter clockwise. In total there are 12 different markers for a 3x3x3, with 6 of them 
            being clockwise rotations, and 6 being counterclockwise rotations.

         <ol> 
            <li>"F" stands for front facing side (the side facing you)</li>
            <li>"B" stands for back facing side (the side facing away from you)</li>
